		<h1>All about Background Checks</h1>
		<div class="intro">
			<p>	When a client calls in and asks: "How do I run background checks?"</p>
			<p> If they've never done it before Follow these steps:</p>
			<h1>Adding Background Check Capability to a New Account:</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>While on the phone with the customer: Get their <span>Contact Information</span>.</li>
				<li>Next you'll pass that info to the Head of Billing (Currently Pearl).</li>
				<li>During this time Billing has to speak with our Background Check Company called Sapphire.</li>
				<li>Billing will then send the client an agreement that they have to sign Electronically.</li>
				<li>After signing the document, Head of Billing will contact Head of Support (currently Jeffrey) to activate Background Checks.</li>
				<li>This is done by going to Setup > System > Background Check > Then Adding the Sapphie Background Check.</li>
				<li>Now Background Checks are ready to be used.</li>
				<li>Contact the client and let them know that we've added the Background Check service onto the account.</li>
				<li>Now it's done! They've gained the ability to run Background Checks on their account.</li>

		<h1> Using Background Checks </h1>
		<h3>So next we'll walk them through <span>using</span> Background Checks</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Take them to the <span>Hiring Tab</span>.</li>
			<li>Now they have to make a Job Opening. Make them select "New Opening"</li>
			<li>They fill in the information and list their job.</li>
			<li>Some of these fields can be set so that they <span>must</span> be filled out</li>
			<li>As they're filling out the listing, instruct them they must require a few fields: 
				<ol>
					<li><span>Social Security</span></li> 
					<li><span>Background Check Permissions</span>.</li>
					<li>Birthdate</li>
					<li>Name</li>
					<li>Address</li>
				</ol>
			<p> <span class="notice"><strong>Note:</strong></span> 
				<ul>
					<li>
						If the Employer Doesn't Make Permission for Background Checks Required, and the hire denies the permission, they wont be able to run the Background Check. 
					</li>
					<li> 
						You can't run a Background Check without a Social Security Number, so it should be required, as well
					</li> 
					<li> 
						Name and Address are also recommended fields to require for the application.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Be sure to tell them to make these fields required in their listing!</strong>
					</li>	
				</ul>
			</p>
			<li>
				After creating the listing, instruct them to give the Job Opening link to a prospective
				employee or place it where they wish, such as Craigslist or their own website. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Now, when the New Hire clicks on the listing and fills it out they can run the <span>Background Check</span>
			</li>
		</ol>
